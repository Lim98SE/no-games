<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We're just a few dudes reviewing games. We try to be as non-objective as possible, since my co-founder Trace hates some sites <i>not naming names but IGN</i> for that.</p>

<p>This game is awesome. One of the best modern games and my personal favorite rhythm game, although it's also the only rhythym game I've ever played. The soundtrack is awesome, the mods are even better, and the game is just amazing</p>
