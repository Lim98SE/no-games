<h1>Friday Night Funkin'</h1>
<p style="font-size-adjust: 0.5"><i>Review by Liam Mowry</i></p>
<p>This game is awesome. One of the best modern games and my <i>personal</i> favorite rhythm game, although it's also the <i>only</i> rhythym game I've ever played. The soundtrack is awesome, the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/166531" target="_blank">mods</a> are even better, and the game is just amazing.</p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p><i>Taken directly from the itch.io</i></p>
<p>Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music...</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>It's like DDR, but for your fingers. Press the arrow key when an arrow is over another arrow. So basically, every other rhythm game.</p>
<p class="score">Score: <p class="score epic">94/100</p></p>
