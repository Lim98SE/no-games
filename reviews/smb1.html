<h1>Super Mario Bros.</h1>
<p style="font-size-adjust: 0.5"><i>Review by Liam Mowry</i></p>
<p>Ok, let me get this out of the way: this game is a masterpiece. It was one of the NES's launch titles, it saved video games in North America, and is just an all-around great game.</p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In terms of plot, we have no plot. You play as Mario Jumpman Mario to save Princess <s>Peach</s> Toadstool.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>You know what Mario is. It's a simple platformer with amazing level design.</p>
<p class="score">Score: <p class="epic score">96/100</p></p>
